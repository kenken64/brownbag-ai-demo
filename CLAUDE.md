This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading system. The codebase is currently being initialized.

## Architecture

This project uses a multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents:

1. **Frontend Developer** (`src/frontend/`) - React/TypeScript UI with real-time WebSocket
2. **Backend Developer** (`src/backend/`) - Node.js/Python APIs and database
3. **Trading Systems Developer** (`src/trading/`) - Trading strategies and risk management
4. **AI/ML Developer** (`src/ml/`) - Predictive models and feature engineering

For detailed agent configuration and responsibilities, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

**Agent Configuration:** `agents-config.yaml`
