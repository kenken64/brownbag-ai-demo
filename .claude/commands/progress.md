# Track PRP Execution Progress

Monitor and report progress on PRP (Project Requirements Plan) execution across all sub-agents.

## Usage

```bash
# Track progress for a specific PRP
claude /progress PRPs/ubs-ai-crypto-trading-bot.md

# Or simply track progress for all active PRPs
claude /progress
```

## Progress Tracking Process

1. **Load PRP File**
   - Read the specified PRP file (or find all PRPs in `PRPs/` directory)
   - Parse all tasks and subtasks
   - Identify agent assignments (@frontend-dev, @backend-dev, @trading-dev, @ai-dev)

2. **Analyze Task Completion**
   - Count total tasks vs completed tasks (checked `[x]` vs unchecked `[ ]`)
   - Calculate completion percentage per agent
   - Identify blocking or overdue tasks
   - Check dependencies between tasks

3. **Workspace Verification**
   - Cross-reference PRP tasks with actual files created
   - Verify implementation matches task descriptions
   - Check for work in progress (modified files, git status)

4. **Timeline Analysis**
   - Compare actual progress vs estimated timeline
   - Calculate burn rate (tasks completed per day/week)
   - Project completion date based on current velocity
   - Identify if project is on track, ahead, or behind schedule

### 📈 Timeline Analysis

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Days Elapsed | 14 days | - | - |
| Tasks Completed | 11 tasks | 12 tasks | 🟡 Slightly Behind |
| Completion Rate | 0.79 tasks/day | 0.86 tasks/day | 🟡 Below Target |
| Projected End Date | Nov 30 | Nov 15 | 🔴 15 days overdue |
| Burn Rate | 45% done in 58% time | 50% target | 🟡 Needs acceleration |

### 🎯 Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path (blocking other work):

1. **Backend API integrations** → Blocks frontend WebSocket implementation
2. **Database schema** → Blocks backend auth and frontend portfolio UI
3. **RL agent development** → Longest remaining task (20h estimate)

---

### ⚡ Recommendations

**To Get Back on Track:**
1. 🎯 **Priority:** Complete backend exchange API integrations (unblocks 3 other tasks)
2. 🤝 **Collaboration:** Backend + Frontend sync on database schema (1h meeting)
3. 📦 **De-scope:** Consider moving RL agent to Phase 2 (saves 20h)
4. ⚡ **Accelerate:** AI/ML agent needs focus - allocate dedicated time blocks
5. 🔄 **Daily Standups:** Implement 15min daily check-ins to unblock dependencies

**Velocity Improvement Needed:** +30% to hit original timeline OR extend deadline by 2 weeks

---

### 📅 Upcoming Milestones

- **Next 3 Days:** Complete exchange API integrations, finalize database schema
- **Next Week:** Frontend portfolio UI, Trading position sizing
- **Next 2 Weeks:** AI sentiment analysis, Backend authentication
- **Month End:** Integration testing, deployment preparation

## Notes

- Progress is calculated based on PRP checkbox completion and file creation verification
- Timeline projections assume consistent velocity
- Blockers are identified from task dependencies and git activity
- Status indicators: 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Behind Schedule
- Update PRP checkboxes regularly for accurate tracking
