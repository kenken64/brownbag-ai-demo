## **2. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### 2.1 Current Bot Limitations
**Market Spike Handling Today:**
- How does your bot currently detect price anomalies on Binance (if at all)?
- What's the average detection lag for significant price movements?
- How many profitable spike opportunities are missed per day/week?
- What's the false signal rate on current spike detection?

**Critical Gap - Market Crash Protection:**
- **Current Risk**: Bot continues trading during market-wide crashes (>15% dumps)
- **Real Scenario**: May 2021 crypto crash - Bitcoin dropped 30% in hours, altcoins 50%+
- **Problem**: Without circuit breaker, bot can:
  - Execute buy orders into falling knife scenarios
  - Open new positions during liquidation cascades
  - Deplete capital trying to "buy the dip" during capitulation
  - Get caught in flash crashes that don't recover
- **Impact**: Potential for catastrophic losses during black swan events

**Binance-Specific Challenges:**
- Binance has highest liquidity but also highest manipulation risk
- Futures market can trigger cascading liquidations affecting spot prices
- Flash crashes more severe on Binance due to high leverage usage
- Need to monitor both spot and futures for accurate market sentiment
- Binance rate limits require efficient API usage
- Multiple market types: Spot, USD-M Futures, COIN-M Futures

### 2.2 Why Current Solutions Fall Short
- Single-threaded analysis can't process multi-factor spike signals fast enough
- Lack of context-awareness (news, social sentiment, on-chain data)
- No collaborative decision-making between analysis, risk, and execution
- Difficulty distinguishing genuine opportunities from manipulated spikes

### 2.3 Desired Future State
Define success:
- Sub-second spike detection across [X] trading pairs
- Multi-dimensional analysis (price, volume, order book, on-chain metrics)
- Intelligent risk assessment before execution
- Adaptive response strategies based on spike characteristics
- Seamless operation without disrupting existing bot strategies

### 4.2 Task Workflow

Define the sequential or parallel tasks:

**Task 0: Market Guardian Monitoring** ⚠️ **CONTINUOUS PARALLEL TASK**
- **Agent**: Market Guardian Agent
- **Type**: Continuous background monitoring (runs independently)
- **Description**: "Continuously monitor BTC, ETH, and market-wide metrics. If any asset drops >15% in 1 hour OR total market cap drops >20% in 4 hours, immediately trigger circuit breaker to halt ALL bot trading activities"
- **Expected Output**: "Circuit breaker status: SAFE / TRIGGERED with detailed crash report"
- **Context**: Real-time Binance market data, liquidation feeds
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - Pre-empts all other tasks
- **Action on Trigger**: 
  1. Set global circuit breaker flag
  2. Cancel all pending orders
  3. Send critical alert to user
  4. Log crash event with full context
  5. Monitor for recovery conditions

**Task 1: Spike Detection**
- **Agent**: Market Scanner Agent
- **Description**: "Continuously monitor [list Binance trading pairs] and identify price movements exceeding [X]% in [Y] timeframe or volume spikes over [Z] standard deviations"
- **Expected Output**: "Spike alert with: asset, magnitude, direction, volume profile, timestamp, confidence score"
- **Context**: Real-time Binance WebSocket data
- **Pre-Check**: Verify circuit breaker is NOT active before proceeding

**Task 2: Market Stability Check**
- **Agent**: Market Guardian Agent
- **Description**: "For detected spike, verify this is an isolated event and not part of a broader market crash. Confirm circuit breaker conditions are not approaching threshold"
- **Expected Output**: "Market stability report: STABLE / WARNING / CRITICAL with current drawdown percentages"
- **Context**: Output from Task 1, current market conditions
- **Action if CRITICAL**: Abort spike trading, prepare for potential circuit breaker

**Task 3: Context Analysis**
- **Agent**: Context Analyzer Agent
- **Description**: "For detected spike, analyze: recent news sentiment, social media buzz, on-chain activity, correlated asset movements on Binance, and manipulation likelihood"
- **Expected Output**: "Context report with: spike catalyst (news/whale/unknown), manipulation probability, Binance liquidity assessment, spot vs futures divergence"
- **Context**: Outputs from Task 1 & 2
- **Condition**: Only runs if Task 2 shows STABLE market

**Task 4: Risk Evaluation**
- **Agent**: Risk Assessment Agent
- **Description**: "Evaluate trade viability considering: current portfolio exposure, account balance, market conditions, Binance slippage estimates, and risk parameters. Double-check with Market Guardian that circuit breaker is not active"
- **Expected Output**: "Risk report with: go/no-go recommendation, suggested position size, stop-loss level, take-profit targets, maximum acceptable slippage"
- **Context**: Outputs from Tasks 1, 2, 3, current portfolio state, circuit breaker status

**Task 5: Trade Execution** (Conditional)
- **Agent**: Strategy Executor Agent
- **Description**: "If approved by Risk Agent AND circuit breaker is NOT active, execute entry at optimal price on Binance, set protective stops, and monitor position until exit conditions met"
- **Expected Output**: "Execution report with: entry price, position size, stops placed, monitoring status"
- **Context**: Outputs from Tasks 1-4

  - Risk Assessment gives approval
  - Circuit breaker status = SAFE
  - Binance API connection healthy

**Task 6: Post-Trade Analysis** (Async)
- **Agent**: Context Analyzer Agent
- **Description**: "After position closed, analyze outcome vs. prediction to improve future spike detection"
- **Expected Output**: "Performance report for model retraining"
- **Context**: Complete trade lifecycle data

**Task 7: Recovery Assessment** (After Circuit Breaker Trigger)
- **Agent**: Market Guardian Agent
- **Description**: "After circuit breaker activation, continuously assess market recovery. When conditions normalize (no further >5% drops in 1 hour, liquidations <$100M/hr, market stable for 30+ minutes), recommend resuming bot operations"
- **Expected Output**: "Recovery status report: RECOVERING / SAFE_TO_RESUME"
- **Action**: User notification with recommendation to resume trading

### 4.3 Crew Configuration

```python
# Example crew setup structure

# Market Guardian runs as a separate continuous monitoring crew
guardian_crew = Crew(
    agents=[market_guardian_agent],
    tasks=[market_monitoring_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    max_rpm=100,
)

# Main spike detection and trading crew
spike_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        market_scanner_agent, 
        context_analyzer_agent, 
        risk_assessment_agent, 
        strategy_executor_agent
    ],
    tasks=[
        spike_detection_task,
        stability_check_task,
        context_analysis_task,
        risk_evaluation_task,
        execution_task
    ],
    process=Process.sequential,  # or Process.hierarchical for manager coordination
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,  # Enable memory for context retention
    max_rpm=100,  # Rate limiting
    # Share circuit breaker state with guardian crew
    shared_state={'circuit_breaker': CircuitBreakerState()}
)
```

**Crew Process Type**: Hybrid (Sequential for spike trading + Parallel guardian monitoring)
- **Guardian Crew**: Runs continuously in parallel, independent of spike trading
- **Spike Trading Crew**: Sequential task execution, but checks guardian status before each critical decision
- Why: Circuit breaker must operate independently to protect against all threats, not just spike-related

**Communication Between Crews**:
- Shared memory/state for circuit breaker status
- Event-driven alerts from Guardian → Spike Trading Crew
- Guardian can interrupt spike trading workflow at any point

**Memory Configuration**:
- Short-term memory: Recent spike patterns (last 24 hours), recent market crashes
- Long-term memory: Historical spike outcomes, historical crash events and recovery times
- Entity memory: Tracked assets and their spike behavior profiles, crash correlation patterns
- Shared memory: Circuit breaker state, current market health score

---

## **5. INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE**

### 5.1 Embedding into Existing Bot

**Current Bot Architecture:**
```
[Describe your current architecture - example below]
Example:
- Main Bot Core: Python FastAPI application
- Strategy Engine: Custom trading logic (DCA, Grid, etc.)
- Exchange Connector: Binance API via python-binance library
- Database: PostgreSQL for trade history
- Message Queue: Redis for order management
- WebSocket Manager: Handles Binance real-time streams
```

**Integration Points:**

1. **Entry Point**:
   - CrewAI agents initialized on bot startup as separate threads/processes
   - **Guardian Crew**: Starts immediately, runs 24/7 as daemon
   - **Spike Trading Crew**: Event-driven initialization when spike detected

2. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   Binance WebSocket → Bot Data Adapter → Market Scanner Agent → 
   Market Guardian (Stability Check) → Context Analyzer Agent → 
   Risk Assessment Agent → [Risk Approval?] → Strategy Executor Agent → 
   Binance API (Order Placement)
   
   [PARALLEL FLOW - ALWAYS RUNNING]
   Binance WebSocket (BTC/ETH/Market) → Market Guardian Agent → 
   [Crash Detected?] → Circuit Breaker Trigger → Bot Control Interface → 
   HALT ALL BOT OPERATIONS
   ```

3. **Circuit Breaker Integration** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**:
   ```
   Market Guardian Agent
          ↓
   Circuit Breaker State Manager (Shared Memory/Redis)
          ↓
   Bot Control Interface
          ↓
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Blocks ALL Trading Operations: │
   │  - Existing strategies paused   │
   │  - New orders rejected          │
   │  - Pending orders cancelled     │
   │  - Spike trading disabled       │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Existing Component Interactions**:
   - **Access Current State**: CrewAI agents query bot's portfolio manager for positions, balance, exposure
   - **Use Exchange Connectors**: CrewAI agents use bot's existing Binance connection pool (no duplicate connections)
   - **Risk Management**: CrewAI risk checks run BEFORE bot's existing risk engine (double validation)
   - **Strategy Coordination**: Circuit breaker disables ALL strategies, not just spike trading
   - **Conflict Prevention**: Spike trading gets separate order queue with priority flag

**Binance-Specific Integration:**

1. **WebSocket Connections**:
   - Reuse bot's existing Binance WebSocket connections (avoid rate limits)
   - Subscribe to additional streams if needed:
     - `!miniTicker@arr` (all market mini-ticker)
     - `btcusdt@aggTrade` (BTC aggregated trades)
     - `btcusdt@depth20@100ms` (order book updates)
     - Futures: `btcusdt_perp@forceOrder` (liquidations)

2. **API Rate Limits** (Critical for Binance):
   - Spot: 1200 requests/minute, 6100 requests/5min
   - Futures: 2400 requests/minute
   - Strategy: Prioritize WebSocket data, use REST only for execution
   - Implement request queuing to avoid bans

3. **Market Data Sources**:
   ```python
   # Primary: Binance WebSocket (real-time)
   - Price updates: <100ms latency
   - Order book: 100ms snapshots
   - Trade feed: Every trade
   
   # Fallback: Binance REST API
   - If WebSocket disconnects
   - For historical data queries
   ```

### 5.2 Technical Integration Requirements

**CrewAI Setup:**
- CrewAI version: [specify, e.g., 0.30.0+]
- LLM provider: [OpenAI GPT-4-turbo / Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Local LLM?]
- API key management and rotation
- Fallback if LLM API is down (rule-based mode for guardian)

**Custom Tools Development:**
List tools that need to be created:

**1. Binance Integration Tools:**
   - **BinanceWebSocketTool**: Real-time price/volume subscription management
   - **BinanceOrderBookTool**: Depth analysis and liquidity assessment
   - **BinanceSpotOrderTool**: Place/cancel spot market orders
   - **BinanceFuturesDataTool**: Monitor futures prices and funding rates
   - **BinanceLiquidationTool**: Track liquidation events
   - **BinanceAccountTool**: Query balance, positions, open orders

**2. Circuit Breaker Tools** ⚠️:
   - **MarketGuardianTool**: Calculate market-wide drawdown percentages
   - **CircuitBreakerControlTool**: Set/clear circuit breaker flag
   - **BotControlTool**: Pause/resume bot operations programmatically
   - **EmergencyOrderCancelTool**: Cancel all pending orders instantly
   - **RecoveryAssessmentTool**: Evaluate if market has stabilized

**3. Analysis Tools:**
   - **OnChainDataTool**: Query Etherscan/BSCScan for whale movements
   - **SentimentAnalysisTool**: Scrape crypto news and Twitter
   - **CorrelationAnalysisTool**: Multi-asset correlation on Binance
   - **ManipulationDetectorTool**: Pump-and-dump pattern recognition
   - **PortfolioStateTool**: Access current bot portfolio
   - **RiskCalculatorTool**: Apply bot's risk rules

**State Management:**
- **Shared State**: Circuit breaker status accessible to all agents and main bot
- **Concurrency Control**: Thread-safe access to circuit breaker flag (Redis with locks)
- **State Persistence**: Agent memory + circuit breaker state survives bot restarts
- **Recovery State**: Track recovery progress after circuit breaker trigger

**Configuration Management:**
```yaml
# config/crewai_spike_agent.yaml
circuit_breaker:
  enabled: true
  thresholds:
    btc_dump_1h: 15.0  # percent
    eth_dump_1h: 15.0
    market_dump_4h: 20.0
    liquidations_1h: 500000000  # $500M
  recovery_conditions:
    stabilization_period: 1800  # 30 minutes
    max_drawdown_allowed: 5.0  # during recovery period
    min_liquidations: 100000000  # <$100M/hr
  actions_on_trigger:
    - cancel_all_orders
    - pause_all_strategies
    - close_positions: false  # optional: close all positions
    - notify_user: true
    - log_crash_event: true

spike_detection:
  enabled: true
  binance:
    spot_pairs: ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "BNBUSDT"]
    futures_pairs: ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"]
    websocket_streams: ["!miniTicker@arr", "@depth20@100ms"]
  
agents:
  market_guardian:
    enabled: true
    priority: highest
    monitoring_interval_ms: 1000
    llm_model: "gpt-4-turbo"  # or "claude-3-5-sonnet"
  
  market_scanner:
    enabled: true
    check_circuit_breaker: true  # don't process spikes if guardian triggered
```

**Performance Considerations:**

**Latency Optimization:**
- Guardian agent checks every 1 second (configurable)
- Use cached market data where possible
- Pre-calculate rolling statistics to avoid lag
- Async/await patterns throughout
- Direct Binance WebSocket (no polling)

**Resource Management:**
- Guardian process: Dedicated CPU core, 100MB memory budget
- Spike crew: Shared resources, 400MB memory budget
- Queue depth limits: Max 10 pending spike analyses
- Agent timeout: 5 seconds max per analysis
- Graceful degradation: If guardian fails, default to SAFE mode (halt trading)

## **6. BINANCE & CRYPTO-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**

### 6.1 Binance Market Characteristics

**24/7 Operation:**
- Continuous monitoring with no market close
- Agent fatigue prevention (rotating emphasis, periodic recalibration)
- Off-hours spike handling (lower liquidity considerations)
- Weekend volatility (traditional markets closed, crypto active)

**Binance-Specific Behaviors:**
- **Highest Liquidity**: Generally best prices and depth
- **Spot vs Futures**: Futures can lead spot on major moves
- **Liquidation Cascades**: Futures liquidations can trigger spot crashes
- **Funding Rates**: Extreme rates signal overleveraged positions
- **Binance Launchpad**: New token listings cause related asset volatility
- **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled downtime 00:00-01:00 UTC occasionally

**Multiple Market Types on Binance:**
- **Spot**: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT (physical settlement)
- **USD-M Futures**: BTCUSDT perpetual (cash settled)
- **COIN-M Futures**: BTCUSD quarterly (coin settled)
- Each market can show different signals

**Binance Rate Limits:**
- Spot REST: 1200 req/min, 6100 req/5min
- Futures REST: 2400 req/min
- WebSocket: 10 connections, 300 msgs/second per connection
- **Violation = IP ban**: Must carefully manage request budgets

### 6.2 Circuit Breaker Activation Criteria ⚠️

**Primary Triggers (ANY condition activates circuit breaker):**

1. **Bitcoin Crash Trigger**:
   - BTC drops >15% in 1 hour (from peak to current)
   - BTC drops >20% in 4 hours
   - BTC flash crash: >10% in 5 minutes

2. **Ethereum Crash Trigger**:
   - ETH drops >15% in 1 hour
   - ETH drops >25% in 4 hours
   - ETH flash crash: >12% in 5 minutes

3. **Market-Wide Crash Trigger**:
   - Total crypto market cap drops >20% in 4 hours
   - Top 10 coins (by market cap) all down >15% simultaneously
   - Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops to "Extreme Fear" (<10) within 1 hour

4. **Binance-Specific Triggers**:
   - Binance Futures liquidations exceed $500M in 1 hour
   - Binance spot trading volume drops >80% suddenly (exchange issue)
   - Funding rate reaches extremes (>1% 8-hour rate, indicates panic)

5. **Systemic Risk Triggers**:
   - Major stablecoin (USDT/USDC) depegs >3%
   - Large exchange (Coinbase, Kraken) reports outage/hack
   - Regulatory news indicates trading halt possibility

**Calculation Method:**
```python
# Example: BTC 15% dump in 1 hour
btc_current_price = get_binance_price("BTCUSDT")
btc_1h_high = get_rolling_high("BTCUSDT", period="1h")
drawdown = ((btc_1h_high - btc_current_price) / btc_1h_high) * 100

if drawdown >= 15.0:
    trigger_circuit_breaker(reason="BTC dropped {drawdown:.1f}% in 1 hour")
```

**False Positive Prevention:**
- Require confirmation from multiple data sources (spot + futures)
- 10-second stabilization check (ensure not just a wick)
- Verify Binance API is functioning (not data error)
- Cross-check with other exchanges for correlation

### 6.3 Circuit Breaker Actions

**Immediate Actions (within 5 seconds):**
1. Set global `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ACTIVE = True` flag
2. Cancel ALL pending orders on Binance (spot & futures)
3. Pause ALL trading strategies (DCA, Grid, Spike, etc.)
4. Log detailed crash event with full market snapshot
5. Send CRITICAL alert to user (all channels: app, email, SMS)

**Position Management (user configurable):**
- **Option A (Conservative)**: Close all positions at market
- **Option B (Default)**: Keep positions, set tight stop-losses
- **Option C (Aggressive)**: Keep positions, no action (user monitors)

**User Notification Content:**
```
🚨 CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED 🚨

Reason: Bitcoin dropped 17.3% in 52 minutes
Current BTC: $42,150 (was $50,850)
Market Cap: -$180B (-18.5%)
Liquidations: $687M in last hour

Actions Taken:
✓ All orders cancelled
✓ All strategies paused
✓ Bot is in SAFE MODE

Your Positions:
- 0.5 BTC: -$4,350 unrealized loss
- 10 ETH: -$2,800 unrealized loss

Recommendation: Wait for market stabilization
Bot will auto-resume when safe (ETA: ~45 min)
```

### 6.4 Recovery & Resume Conditions

**Recovery Assessment (runs every 30 seconds after trigger):**

Circuit breaker will auto-clear when ALL conditions met:
1. **Stabilization Period**: No further >5% drops for 30 minutes
2. **Liquidation Slowdown**: <$100M liquidations per hour
3. **Market Recovery**: BTC recovered >50% of initial drop
4. **Volume Normalization**: Trading volume returns to >70% of average
5. **Manual Override**: User can manually resume earlier (with warning)

**Resume Process:**
1. Market Guardian sets `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ACTIVE = False`
2. Send notification: "Market stabilized, bot resuming operations"
3. Re-enable trading strategies (user can select which ones)
4. Resume spike detection (but with increased caution for 1 hour)
5. Log recovery event for analysis

### 6.5 Spike Detection Criteria (Binance-focused)

Define Binance-specific spike types to detect:

**Type 1: Spot Price Spike (Pump/Dump)**
- Threshold: [X]% move in [Y] minutes
- Volume requirement: [Z]x average Binance spot volume
- Order book: Minimum $100K liquidity within 1%
- Examples: BTC sudden 8% pump in 10 minutes on 4x volume

**Type 2: Futures-Spot Divergence**
- Threshold: Futures price diverges >2% from spot
- Duration: Sustained for >5 minutes
- Signal: Arbitrage opportunity or forced liquidations
- Action: Trade the cheaper market (usually spot)

**Type 3: Volume Explosion**
- Threshold: Volume > 5 standard deviations from 24h average
- Price impact: Any direction (up, down, or sideways)
- Binance ranking: Coin jumps >10 positions on volume leaderboard
- Signal: Major whale accumulation or news event

## **19. OPEN QUESTIONS**

List questions that need answers before proceeding:

1. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. local LLM? (cost, latency, quality tradeoffs)
2. **Agent Autonomy**: Fully autonomous or human-in-the-loop for large trades?
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Manual vs. ML-based adaptive thresholds?
4. **Multi-Exchange Execution**: Should spike trades execute across multiple exchanges simultaneously?
5. **Memory Duration**: How long should agents remember past spike patterns (hours, days, weeks)?
6. **Failure Mode**: If risk agent rejects, should we alert user or silently skip?
7. **Cost Limits**: What's our monthly budget for LLM API calls?
8. **Slippage Tolerance**: What's acceptable slippage before aborting trade?
9. **Correlation Handling**: How to handle multiple correlated assets spiking simultaneously?
10. **User Control**: Should users be able to edit agent prompts directly?

## **20. APPENDICES**

### Appendix A: Glossary

- **Spike**: A rapid price movement exceeding defined thresholds
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration framework
- **Agent**: An AI entity with specific role, goal, and tools
- **Task**: A specific job assigned to an agent
- **Crew**: A group of agents working together
- **Tool**: A function that agents can call to interact with systems
- **Pump**: Sudden upward price movement
- **Dump**: Sudden downward price movement
- **Slippage**: Difference between expected and actual execution price
- **Flash Crash**: Extreme rapid price drop (often recovers quickly)
- **Whale**: Large holder whose trades significantly impact price
- **On-Chain**: Data stored on blockchain (vs. exchange internal data)

### Appendix B: CrewAI Prompt Examples

**Market Scanner Agent Prompt:**
```
You are an expert crypto market surveillance specialist. Your job is to continuously monitor price and volume data across cryptocurrency markets and identify anomalous movements that could represent trading opportunities.

Your specific responsibilities:
1. Analyze real-time price changes across all monitored trading pairs
2. Calculate statistical deviations from normal behavior
3. Identify volume spikes that accompany price movements
4. Assign confidence scores to detected anomalies
5. Generate structured spike alerts for further analysis

Focus on precision and speed. False negatives (missed spikes) are acceptable, but minimize false positives (alerting on non-spikes) as they waste resources.

Output format: JSON with spike details including asset, magnitude, direction, volume, timestamp, and confidence score.
```

### Appendix C: Example Tool Implementation

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Exchange Data Tool")
def get_current_price(symbol: str, exchange: str = "binance") -> dict:
    """
    Fetches current price and volume data for a trading pair.
    
    Args:
        symbol: Trading pair (e.g. "BTC/USDT")
        exchange: Exchange name (default: binance)
    
    Returns:
        dict with price, volume, bid, ask, timestamp
    """
    # Your implementation here using existing bot's exchange connector
    pass
```

### Appendix D: Risk Calculation Formulas

**Position Size Formula:**
```
position_size = (account_balance * risk_percent) / stop_loss_distance
```

**Kelly Criterion:**
```
kelly_percent = (win_rate * avg_win - (1 - win_rate) * avg_loss) / avg_win
position_size = kelly_percent * account_balance * kelly_fraction
```

### Appendix E: Backtesting Data Requirements

- Historical OHLCV data: 1-minute granularity, 6+ months
- Labeled spike events with outcomes
- Market condition tags (bull/bear/sideways)
- Exchange downtime periods to exclude
- Known manipulation events to train on
